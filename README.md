Originally written just so I could get an RSS feed for my favourite DRTV shows.
Feature creep resulted in building an invidious-like frontend.

An instance is hosted at https://drtv.rend.al

## Quick Start
```
$ nix develop
$ gunicorn drtvrss:app
```
The project is set up using Nix.
Running the project without Nix is not supported.
Running the project with Nix is also not supported.
What I'm trying to say is, you're on your own buddy.
